## About
This repository contains all the code used for the Dynamic and Intelligent Creatures using Keyframed Animations project excluding the company data which can be provided upon request. 

## Folders
There are 4 folders:

* `pytorch-deepphase` is the PyTorch DeepPhase implementation from https://github.com/sebastianstarke/AI4Animation adapted to the project
* `pytorch-pfnn` is the rewritten PyTorch implementation based on the orginal paper by Holden  et al. https://theorangeduck.com/media/uploads/other_stuff/phasefunction.pdf adapted to the project
* `unity-deepphase` is the Unity DeepPhase implementation from https://github.com/sebastianstarke/AI4Animation adapted to the project
* `unity-ofnn` is the Unity PFNN implementation from https://github.com/sebastianstarke/AI4Animation adapted to the project

## Usage Instructions

* To run Unity implementations open the respective folder as a unity project and navigate to the Dev/Demo environments which will have demo scenes avaiable.

* For  `pytorch-pfnn`  use the requirements.txt file in the respective folder to create a virtual environment. The you can simply run the  `PFNN_train.ipynb`.

* For `pytorch-deepphase`  the respective README.md contains detailed instructions.
